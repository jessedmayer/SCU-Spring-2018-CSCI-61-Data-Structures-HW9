1. (10 points) Implement a function for the graph.h class that finds the longest distance between any two vertices in a graph.

2. (15 points) A doublets puzzle is a pair of words of the same length, such as hate and love. To solve the puzzle, you must produce a sequence of words such as hate have lave love. In this sequence, the first and last words are the given words, and adjacent words differ at exactly one position (so all words must have the same length).

Write a C++ program to solve doublets puzzles of length 5. Your solution must use words in Donald Knuth's dictionaryPreview the documentView in a new window of common 5-letter words. You may use the textbook's implementation of a graph or the this graph.hPreview the documentView in a new window

Report the output of your program for the following puzzles:

black white
tears smile
small giant
stone money
angel devil
amino right
amigo signs

One way to solve this puzzle is to represent the given dictionary as a graph whose vertices are the words and whose edges connect two words differing at exactly one position. To solve a puzzle, perform a breadth-first search starting with the first word until the second word is found. You may want to implement the following member function for the class graph:

// pre: source < n(), dest < n()
// post: returns a path from source to dest with the least number of edges in this graph using bfs
std::vector<std::size_t> graph::shortest_path(std::size_t source, std::size_t dest)
